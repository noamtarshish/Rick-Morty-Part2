# Rick-Morty-Part2
Second part of C project developed as part of an Advanced Programming course, providing a comprehensive management system for characters from the 'Rick and Morty' series

# Jerry Daycare Management System

Welcome to the Jerry Daycare Management System repository! This system is designed to efficiently manage Jerries, taking special care to prevent memory leaks and providing features like reading/writing from files in C programming language.

## Project Files and Functionality

1. **Jerry.h**: Contains the struct definition for the Jerry object and function signatures related to Jerries.

2. **Jerry.c**: Includes functions necessary for Jerry management and additional functions built for the program.

3. **LinkedList.h**: Contains function signatures for generic linked list operations.

4. **LinkedList.c**: Defines the structure for a generic data structure and includes a Node structure for linked lists. Additionally, it contains implementations for functions related to the generic data structure.

5. **KeyValuePair.h**: Holds function signatures for key-value pair operations.

6. **KeyValuePair.c**: Implements the generic key-value pair data structure and related functions.

7. **HashTable.h**: Contains function signatures for hash table operations.

8. **HashTable.c**: Implements the generic hash table structure and the required functions for managing key-value pairs. It also initially contains generic functions for working with KVP as nodes within a generic linked list.

9. **MultiValueHashTable.h**: Holds function signatures for multi-value hash table operations.

10. **MultiValueHashTable.c**: Implements the generic multi-value hash table structure, with most functions building upon those in HashTable.c.

11. **Defs.h**: Contains enums and typedefs for generic functions used throughout the project.

12. **JerryBoreeMain.c**: This main program file manages Jerry daycare. The file is divided into reading from a configuration file and implementing a menu for daycare management.

Feel free to explore the code to understand the specifics of Jerry daycare management and memory safety implemented in the system.
